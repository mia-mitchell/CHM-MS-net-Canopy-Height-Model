# SatCHM (Satellite Canopy Height Model)

# Motivation
High-resolution monitoring of forest structure and productivity is essential for effective natural resource management. However, monitoring approaches such as field-based forest inventories or extensive lidar campaigns are costly, time-intensive, and spatially limited. Therefore, inexpensive and accessible methods are needed. SatCHM (Satellite Canopy Height Model) was developed to be an accessible and open-source tool for researchers, allowing for site-specific and temporally flexible predictions of canopy height with limited computational resources. SatCHM requires four inputs: panchromatic satellite imagery, solar and sensor angle metadata of satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and lidar-produced CHMs for an area of interest. After SatCHM pre-processes inputs, data is loaded into a collection of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-to-image regression. This ensemble cooperates to yield high-resolution predictions (up to 0.5-meter) of three-dimensional tree structure with discernible tree crowns across a broader defined area of interest. 

These are the required inputs to use **SatCHM**:

## Dependencies

### Python version
This project is developed and tested with **Python 3.12**. It may work with other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

### Creating your environment
```
pip install -r satchmenv.txt
```
### Install Pytorch
```
pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```
This specifies CUDA 11.8 (as indicated by cu118). However, you must adjust this version based on:

- The CUDA version installed on your system

- You are using pip or conda

- Your operating system and Python version

Download from [PyTorch Get Started Locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). **There, you can select your preferences (OS, package manager, Python version, and CUDA version), and it will generate the exact install command you need.**


## Getting Started

### Tutorial Data

 Throughout the documentation, we will be using the project 'caldor' as an example. Caldor references the Caldor Fire of 2021, south of Lake Tahoe, California. All satellite images were taken before this fire occured. The worldview satellite images were downloaded from Vantor (formerly Maxar Intelligence). Airborne lidar data of south Lake Tahoe was collected in 2010 and was downloaded from [NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/ornl-cloud-cms-lidar-agb-california-1537-1#toc-product-summary). 

<div align="center">

</div>

#### To download tutorial data, following these instructions:

(1) Download [Pelican]("https://docs.pelicanplatform.org/install"). Pelican is an open-source data repository platform.

(2) Run the Pelican download command in terminal. Navigate to your preferred destitation. 

```
(satchmenv) mia /mnt/c/Users/miashell/Documents >  pelican object sync pelican://osg-htc.org/ndp/public/LANLCHM/ ./LANLCHM/
```

### Creating .env file
Create a .env file where the repo is located. Edit the file in a text editor.


|      Rows     | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| project_dir  | the project directory for the products of preprocessing, the neural network & post-processing  |
| site  | the name of the site you are processing |
| utm  | the Universal Transversal Mercator EPSG code (i.e. EPSG:32610)   |
| dem_path | the path to the DEM GeoTIFF of the site (ends in .tif or .tiff) |
| lidar_path | the path to the lidar-produced CHM GeoTIFF within the site (ends in .tif or .tiff)  |
| site_shapefile_dir | the path to the directory to the shapefile of the site   |
| satellite_download_dir| the path to the directory that holds the satellite GeoTIFFs   |
| angle_metadata| the path to the .csv that holds solar and sensor angle metadata   |

```
Document the appropriate paths and directories in the .env before running the program. A blank template for angle metadata csv is included in this repo. If using the tutorial data, the angle metadata is located in the data repository.

If you are using your own imagery, [see additional details here](./docs/OWNIMAGERY.md) and place your imagery in the **satellite_download_dir** specified in your .env. 


## Running Main


After creating the .env, run main.
```console
(satchmenv) mia /mnt/c/Users/miashell/Documents/CHM-MS-net-Canopy-Height-Model > python main.py

### Tiling satellite imagery, DEMs, and lidar data
Satellite imagery, the digital elevation models (DEMs), Lidar-produced canopy height models (CHMs) will first be tiled to 2020 x 2020 pixels  and subsequently tiled into 512 x 512 pixel inputs for the neural network. All data is resampled to 0.5 m -- therefore each final input GeoTIFF spatially translates to 256 x 256 meters. Since there are multiple satellite GeoTIFFs, they are merged before tiling unlike the DEMs and CHMs. 

<div align="center">
<img src="pictures/partition.png">
</div>

Site and date of acquitistion (YYYY-MM-DD) are included in the file name. Moreover, the naming convention of each file is based on the easting and northing (rounded to the nearest thousand) in the southwest corner of the first partition. Subsequently, the GeoTIFF is partitioned into sixteenths and named according to the diagram above. 

  <div style="text-align:center">
